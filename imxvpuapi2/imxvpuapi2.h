/************************************************/
/******* DECODER STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS *******/
/************************************************/


/* OVERVIEW ABOUT DECODING
 *
 *
 * INITIALIZING THE DECODER
 *
 * First, a stream buffer must be allocated. This is a DMA buffer that
 * is allocated with libimxdmabuffer's imx_dma_buffer_allocate(). The required
 * size and alignment can be retrieved from the min_required_stream_buffer_size
 * and required_stream_buffer_physaddr_alignment fields that are present in
 * the ImxVpuApiDecGlobalInfo structure. To get the const global instance
 * of that structure, use imx_vpu_api_dec_get_global_info().
 *
 * NOTE: If min_required_stream_buffer_size is 0, then this first step
 * is to be skipped, since this then means that the VPU does not need
 * a stream buffer.
 *
 * Once the stream buffer is allocated, an ImxVpuApiDecOpenParams structure
 * must be initialized. At the very least, its compression_format field
 * must be set to a valid value. Be sure to set any unused field to zero.
 *
 * The decoder can then be created by calling imx_vpu_api_dec_open(). That
 * function needs the stream buffer and ImxVpuApiDecOpenParams structure.
 *
 *
 * MAIN DECODING LOOP
 *
 * The decoding loop goes as follows:
 *
 * 1. Fill an ImxVpuApiEncodedFrame instance with information about the frame
 *    that is to be decoded. If there are no more frames to encode, continue
 *    at step 5.
 * 2. Feed that frame into the VPU by calling imx_vpu_api_dec_push_encoded_frame().
 * 3. If the stream info was already retrieved, and in the global info, the
 *    IMX_VPU_API_DEC_GLOBAL_INFO_FLAG_DECODED_FRAMES_ARE_FROM_BUFFER_POOL flag
 *    is not set, set the previously allocated output DMA buffer as the
 *    decoder's output buffer with imx_vpu_api_dec_set_output_frame_dma_buffer().
 * 4. Call imx_vpu_api_dec_decode() and get its output code.
 * 5. - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_MORE_INPUT_DATA_NEEDED,
 *      go back to step 1.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_NO_OUTPUT_YET_AVAILABLE,
 *      just go back to step 4.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_EOS, go to step 6.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_NEW_STREAM_INFO_AVAILABLE,
 *      the stream info must be retrieved with imx_vpu_api_dec_get_stream_info().
 *      The stream info contains details about the necessary framebuffers. At this
 *      point, the user must allocate at least as many framebuffers as indicated
 *      by the min_num_required_framebuffers field in ImxVpuApiDecStreamInfo.
 *      (min_num_required_framebuffers can be 0 if the VPU does not use buffer
 *      pool, or performs allocation for its buffer pool internally.)
 *      The details about the framebuffers like its minimum size and alignment are
 *      found in that structure as well. After allocating the buffers, they are
 *      added to the VPU decoder with imx_vpu_api_dec_add_framebuffers_to_pool().
 *      Additionally, an "output buffer" must be allocated at this point if the
 *      IMX_VPU_API_DEC_GLOBAL_INFO_FLAG_DECODED_FRAMES_ARE_FROM_BUFFER_POOL in
 *      the ImxVpuApiDecGlobalInfo structure is not set (see step 3 above).
 *      The output buffer's size must be at least min_output_framebuffer_size
 *      from the ImxVpuApiDecStreamInfo structure.
 *      Then go back to step 4.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_NEED_ADDITIONAL_FRAMEBUFFER,
 *      allocate an extra framebuffer and add it to the VPU decoder's pool,
 *      just like in step 5 above (except add just 1 buffer here, not the amount
 *      added in that step). Then go back to step 4.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_DECODED_FRAME_AVAILABLE,
 *      retrieve the decoded frame with imx_vpu_api_dec_get_decoded_frame(), and
 *      then go back to step 4.
 *      Once that decoded frame is fully processed by the code and is no longer
 *      needed, and IMX_VPU_API_DEC_GLOBAL_INFO_FLAG_DECODED_FRAMES_ARE_FROM_BUFFER_POOL
 *      is not set in the ImxVpuApiDecGlobalInfo structure, then call
 * 	    imx_vpu_api_dec_return_framebuffer_to_decoder() to return the buffer that
 *      contains the no longer needed frame back to the VPU's pool.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_FRAME_SKIPPED, retrieve
 *      the details about the skipped frame with imx_vpu_api_dec_get_skipped_frame_info(),
 *      then go back to step 4.
 *    - if the output code is IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_VIDEO_PARAMETERS_CHANGED,
 *      drain the decoder as explained below, close the current decoder with
 *      imx_vpu_api_dec_close(), deallocate all framebuffers and the output buffer
 *      (if present), open a new decoder with imx_vpu_api_dec_open(), and go back
 *      to step 2, feedin the same data into the encoder that was previously fed
 *      and which produced this output code.
 * 5. Drain the decoder as explained below.
 * 6. Exit the loop.
 *
 *
 * DRAINING THE DECODER
 *
 * NOTE: This refers to the full draining that is done when the stream ends
 * and is done before the decoder is closed. Consult the documentation at
 * imx_vpu_api_dec_enable_drain_mode() for details about this.
 *
 * Draining is done by first calling imx_vpu_api_dec_enable_drain_mode(),
 * followed by repeatedly calling imx_vpu_api_dec_decode() until until one
 * of the terminating cases occur:
 *
 *   1. The IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_MORE_INPUT_DATA_NEEDED output
 *      code is returned
 *   2. The IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_EOS output code is returned
 *   3. A return code that indicates an error is returned
 *
 *
 * SHUTTING DOWN THE DECODER
 *
 * The decoder is shut down by calling imx_vpu_api_dec_close(). Once
 * that was called, the framebuffers that were previously added to the
 * VPU decoder's pool are no longer used, and can be deallocated. Note
 * that calling imx_vpu_api_dec_close() will also drop any decoded
 * frame data that may be queued in the decoder. Consider draining
 * the decoder before shutting it down.

/************************************************/
/******* ENCODER STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS *******/
/************************************************/


/* OVERVIEW ABOUT ENCODING
 *
 *
 * INITIALIZING THE ENCODER
 *
 * First, a stream buffer must be allocated. This is a DMA buffer that
 * is allocated with libimxdmabuffer's imx_dma_buffer_allocate(). The required
 * size and alignment can be retrieved from the min_required_stream_buffer_size
 * and required_stream_buffer_physaddr_alignment fields that are present in
 * the ImxVpuApiEncGlobalInfo structure. To get the const global instance
 * of that structure, use imx_vpu_api_enc_get_global_info().
 *
 * NOTE: If min_required_stream_buffer_size is 0, then this first step
 * is to be skipped, since this then means that the VPU does not need
 * a stream buffer.
 *
 * Once the stream buffer is allocated, an ImxVpuApiEncOpenParams structure
 * must be initialized. Typically, using imx_vpu_api_enc_set_default_open_params()
 * to fill that structure with default values and then optionally tweaking
 * some of that structure's values is the preferred way to initialize it.
 *
 * The encoder can then be created by calling imx_vpu_api_enc_open(). That
 * function needs the stream buffer and ImxVpuApiEncOpenParams structure.
 *
 * Immediately after creating the encoder, it is necessary to retrieve the
 * stream info by calling imx_vpu_api_enc_get_stream_info(). That structure
 * contains several details about the VPU framebuffers like their metrics,
 * the minimum framebuffer pool size etc. If that structure's
 * min_num_required_framebuffers field is nonzero, then the VPU uses a framebuffer
 * pool for its encoding. That pool is not used for output, just for internal
 * temporary data for the encoder's work. At least as many framebuffers as
 * indicated by that field must be allocated and added to the VPU encoder's
 * pool. The framebuffer size in bytes can be looked up in the strema info's
 * min_framebuffer_size field (also look at framebuffer_alignment), and the
 * framebuffer must be a DMA buffer, allocated with imx_dma_buffer_allocate().
 * Once allocated, imx_vpu_api_enc_add_framebuffers_to_pool() must be called
 * to add the buffer to the pool. The buffer stays in the pool until the
 * encoder is closed.
 *
 *
 * MAIN ENCODING LOOP
 *
 * The encoding loop goes as follows:
 *
 * 1. Fill an ImxVpuApiRawFrame instance with information about the frame
 *    that is to be encoded. If there are no more frames to encode, continue
 *    at step 5.
 * 2. Feed that frame into the VPU by calling imx_vpu_api_enc_push_raw_frame().
 * 3. Call imx_vpu_api_enc_encode() and get its output code.
 * 4. - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_MORE_INPUT_DATA_NEEDED,
 *      go back to step 1.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_NO_OUTPUT_YET_AVAILABLE,
 *      just go back to step 3.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_ENCODED_FRAME_AVAILABLE,
 *      use imx_vpu_api_enc_get_encoded_frame() to retrieve the encoded frame,
 *      output the encoded frame, then go back to step 3.
 *    - If the output code is IMX_VPU_API_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_NEED_ADDITIONAL_FRAMEBUFFER,
 *      add a framebuffer with imx_vpu_api_enc_add_framebuffers_to_pool(), then
 *      go back to step 3.
 * 5. Drain the encoder as explained below.
 * 6. Exit the loop.
 *
 *
 * DRAINING THE ENCODER
 *
 * To drain the encoder, all that is needed is to repeatedly call
 * imx_vpu_api_enc_encode() (_without_ any imx_vpu_api_enc_push_raw_frame()
 * calls) until one of the terminating cases occur:
 *
 *   1. The IMX_VPU_API_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_MORE_INPUT_DATA_NEEDED output
 *      code is returned
 *   2. A return code that indicates an error is returned
 *
 *
 * SHUTTING DOWN THE ENCODER
 *
 * The encoder is shut down by calling imx_vpu_api_enc_close(). Once
 * that was called, the framebuffers that were previously added to the
 * VPU encoder's pool are no longer used, and can be deallocated. Note
 * that calling imx_vpu_api_enc_close() will also drop any encoded
 * frame data that may be queued in the encoder. Consider draining
 * the encoder before shutting it down.
