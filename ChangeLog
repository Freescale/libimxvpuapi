==== version 2.3.0 (2023-07-30) ====

* vpu: Implement first working version of VC8000E encoder integration
  This adds support for the Hanto VC8000E encoder that can be found on
  the i.MX8m plus. The VC8000E encoder integration is not finished.
  h.264 encoding works fine. h.265 encoding is not yet done. And,
  changing framerate mid-stream is currently not supported.
* Replace mxcfb.h with ipu.h in option description
  Some BSPs no longer ship with the mxcfb.h header.
* imx6-coda: Fix ENC_ENABLE_SOF_STUFF check
  The check was being performed incorrectly, leading to nullbytes
  being inserted at the end of the SOF0 marker.
* imx6-coda: Insert JFIF APP0 segment
  The VPU does not insert this segment on its own. Some programs need
  JFIF data to be present in JPEG files, so insert APP0 manually.
* imx6-coda: Fix decoder and encoder alignments
* imx6-coda: Add more IPU detiler logging
* imx6-coda: Fix decoder Y/U/V offset alignments
  As it turns out, these must be aligned to 8-byte boundaries, not to
  4096 byte ones. The latter caused incorrect offset calculations.

==== version 2.2.2 (2022-12-28) ====

* imx6-coda: Skip incomplete frames instead of just reporting them
* imx6-coda: Only flush bit buffer when framebuffers were registered
  This prevents misleading error-level log lines from occurring
* imx6-coda: Prefer semi planar modes over fully planar ones
* imx8m-hantro: Reset decoder write_offset to fill_level when moving read_offset
* Add imx_vpu_api_is_color_format_tiled() function
* update waf to 2.0.24
* Add closed_gop_interval field to ImxVpuApiEncOpenParams
  This allows for enforcing regularly occurring IDR
  boundaries when encoding to h.264
* imx8m-hantro: Fix supported decoder color formats and include tiled formats
* Fix and improve h.264 max level estimation for encoding
* imx6-coda: Use 2-row alignment in encoder
* imx6-coda: Fix JPEG encoding quantization parameter handling in encoder

==== version 2.2.1 (2022-05-10) ====

* Add option to not compile examples
* imx8m-hantro: Allow for reusing decoder after drain mode finishes
* imx6-coda: Reset drain mode after EOS processed
* imx6-coda: Reset drain mode flags when flushing
* Use libimxdmabuffer sync access functions to ensure cache coherence
* Add imx_vpu_api_is_color_format_10bit() function
* Documentation fixes

==== version 2.2.0 (2021-06-14) ====

* Add IMX_VPU_API_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_VIDEO_PARAMETERS_CHANGED output code
* Deprecate drain mode, better document decoder drain mode
* Various documentation fixes and new overviews about en- and
  decoding to help with the basic concepts
* Add note about the current state of i.MX8m plus support
* New functions:
  imx_vpu_api_is_color_format_rgb()
  imx_vpu_api_vp8_profile_number()
  imx_vpu_api_vp8_partition_count_number()
  imx_vpu_api_vp9_profile_number()
  imx_vpu_api_enc_set_frame_rate()
* imx6-coda: Fix decoded frame fb_context
  This was causing crashes when callers relied on said fb_context

==== version 2.1.2 (2021-04-25) ====

* imx6-coda: Fix skipped frame reporting
* imx8m-hantro: Handle CODEC_ERROR_FRAME codec state
* imx8m-hantro: Limit supported formats and profiles if building for m8xmm

==== version 2.1.1 (2021-04-23) ====

* imx6 coda: fix bug in IPU based detiling related to frame width/height
* imx6 coda: use the frame width/height from open params if available
* imx6 coda: fix duplicate VPU firmware unloading
* imx8 hantro encoder: fix mid-stream bitrate changes and bitrate logging

==== version 2.1.0 (2020-10-18) ====

* introduce RGB and packed YUV formats since the Hantro encoder
  supports those
* remove hardware specific public headers since they only added
  tiled pixel formats; instead, migrate these tiled formats into
  ImxVpuApiColorFormat
* imx8 hantro decoder: reorder list of supported decoder color
  formats to favor 10 bit output
* imx8 hantro decoder: clear new framebuffer fields to zero
* imx8 hantro encoder: fix segfault caused by trying to unmap
  non existing staged raw frame

==== version 2.0.1 (2020-04-19) ====

* imx6: replace mxcfb.h check with i.MX6 specific imx header check
  the mcxfb.h check only makes sense with i.MX6 devices, so requiring
  those for others like i.MX8 led to build errors
* update waf to 2.0.12 and switch wscript to use Python 3
* imx6: fix encoder pointer usage in vpu_EncGiveCommand() call

==== version 2.0.0 (2019-07-21) ====

* complete rewrite to support i.MX6, i.MX8m, i.MX8mm VPUs

==== version 0.10.3 (2016-10-12) ====

* properly pass on color format in simplified JPEG encoder interface
* add alternative write-callback-style encoding mode
  also add encode example variant which uses write-callback style output
* add support for "fake grayscale mode" in encoders
  this is done by using I420 internally and filling the U and V planes
  with 0x80 bytes
* make sure JPEG quantization table is copied in standardized zig zag order
  the VPU does not, so this has to be done explicitely

==== version 0.10.2 (2016-05-01) ====

* fix AUD NAL positioning in h.264 encoder output
  (SPS/PPS/AUD were ordered incorrectly - AUD has to come first, not last)
* fix build error with examples when --enable-static is used
* pass quality factor in simplified JPEG encoder interface correctly
* add functions for querying and setting header data
  useful for modifying headers, like VUI data in the SPS RBSP
* documentation updates

==== version 0.10.1 (2015-11-30) ====

* add debian packaging files
* update waf to version 1.8.16
* add workaround in wscript to prevent stale pkg-config .pc files
* fix memory leak by adding missing IOFreeVirtMem() call in vpulib backend

==== version 0.10.0 (2015-11-02) ====
